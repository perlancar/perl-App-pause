        - [dist] Use script generated by Perinci::CmdLine::Inline instead of

          packaged in Debian which has a no-convenience-copies policy.

        - [Removed features] To make things simpler and more orthogonal, remove
          aliases list (for ls), delete (for rm); rename subcommands list-dists
          -> ls-dists, list-mods -> ls-mods.

          App-pause-Fatpacked distribution) can also share configuration.

        - Update to WWW::PAUSE::Simple 0.29 (add --protect-files, allow

        - No functional changes.

        - [build] Build fixes: put $DIST in App/pause.pm instead of bin/pause
          (the one which we will use later), use update DZP:Depak 0.10 which
          fixes typo.


0.39    2015-07-05  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - [build] Now use depak (datapack) to pack script instead of fatpack
          (slightly reduce startup overhead, and hope it can now be viewed in
          MetaCPAN, previously MetaCPAN complains that the script is too big.)
          UPDATE: nope, still can't display it. UPDATE 2015-07-27: looks like
          MetaCPAN now can display bin/pause's POD, yay.

        - Bundle Perinci::CmdLine::pause to reduce dependencies (this should've
          been done earlier but was not due to fatten's misconfiguration).

	- No functional changes.

	- [Build] Tweak fatten settings: reactivate stripper=1, no longer
          exclude_prereq DateTime because new Data-Sah no longer depends on it.

0.21    2015-04-15  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - First release, split from WWW-PAUSE-Simple to reduce dependencies for
          that distribution. Use fatpacking to reduce dependencies of the script
          to just LWP::UserAgent and LWP::Protocol::https (both involve XS
          modules so they can't be fatpacked).
